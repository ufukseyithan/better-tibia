Counter-Strike 2D supports Lua scripts since Beta 0.1.1.4

It uses the Lua engine Version 5.1.4
Please visit the Lua homepage for a documentation and manual
www.Lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html

Lua scripting in CS2D is based on events/hooks
Hooks work only SERVERSIDE and NOT CLIENTSIDE! (due to security reasons)

!!! ATTENTION !!!
Using many/complex Lua scripts can make the game slower. Wrong or excessive usage of certain
commands can lead to strange behavior, increased traffic, lags, connection loss or even crashs.

AUTOMATICALLY EXECUTED FILES:

[sys\lua\server.lua]
CS2D will automatically load and execute "sys\lua\server.lua" when hosting a server.
(only if the setting "mp_luaserver" is "server.lua")

[All Lua files in sys\lua\autorun]
All files in the autorun folder will be executed in alphabetic order.
This happens after loading "server.lua" and before loading the map Lua file and the AI file.

[maps\MAPNAME.lua]
In addition CS2D will execute "maps\MAPNAME.lua" when loading a map as server (MAPNAME = name of map)
This happens AFTER executing "server.lua" and only if there is a Lua file for the current map!
(the setting "mp_luamap" has to be "1" as well)

[bots\Standard AI.lua]
This file contains the bot AI Lua script and will be run automatically when starting a server.
It is loaded and executed AFTER all the other Lua files.
You can simply remove or rename this file if you do not want to use bots.

HOW TO HOOK

The following hooks are available. You have to create Lua functions and then you have to attach
these functions to the hook by using the command
addhook("hook", "function" [,priority])
CS2D will execute all attached functions whenever the corresponding hook action occurs in-game.

Priority is only important if there is more than one function attachted to the same hook!
Default is 0, higher numbers = higher priority, lower numbers (also negative) = lower priority.
The attached function with the HIGHEST priority is the LAST function which will be executed.
Moreover CS2D will take the return value of this function (if there is any)!
In most cases you will just omit the priority parameter (yes, it is [optional])!

CS2D will pass parameters to most functions. You can use these parameters but you don't have to!

Some of the hook-functions can also have a return value. This return value influences the way how
CS2D behaves. Returning nothing is like returning 0, "" or nil.
In many cases you can skip the actual action in CS2D by returning 1 (return 1).

Always use just the name of the hook/function for adhook! Don't enter the brackets or parameters!
Always write quotation marks around the hook- and the function-name when using addhook!
RIGHT: addhook("leave","myleavehook")							<- do it this way!
WRONG: addhook("leave(id,reason)","myleavehook(id,reason)")		<- this is NOT going to work!
WRONG: addhook(leave,myleavehook)								<- this is NOT going to work!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use all Lua commands in your CS2D Lua scripts.
Note that there are "CS2D Lua Commands" and ordinary "CS2D Commands". You need to use the "parse"
command to execute ordinary CS2D commands with Lua (ordinary cmds: www.CS2D.com/help.php?cat=all)
You can also use the wrapper-functions in "sys/lua/wrapper.lua" instead of using "parse".
